// Can you find the needle in the haystack?

// Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

// After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

// "found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

function findNeedle(haystack) {
    // your code here
    return `found the needle at position ${haystack.indexOf('needle')}`
  }

/*
Create a function that takes finds the 'needle' in the array and return it's index withing a string
One param an array of strings 
return "found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle
Use indexOf method to return the index positon of the 'needle' within the array
