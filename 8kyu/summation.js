// Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

//for loop 
const summation = function (num) {
    // Code here
    let sum = 0; 
      for(let i = 1; i <=num; i++){
        sum += i
      }
    return sum
  }



/*
Create a function that takes a num and finds the summations of that number.
One param will be a positive integer 
Returning a number that will be the summation of the param 
2 => 1 + 2 => 3 
How all the numbers that make up the param?
Use a for loop
