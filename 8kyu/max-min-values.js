// Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.



// const min = function(list){
    
//     return Math.min(...list);
// }

// const max = function(list){
    
//     return Math.max(...list)
// }

const min = list => Math.min(...list)
const max = list => Math.max(...list)




/*
Create two separate functions one to return the min number in and array and the other array will return the max number in the array
Only one param which be an array of numbers 
Returning the min and max numbers in the array 
Use the math objec of min and max to find the min and max of the array by using the spread operator
